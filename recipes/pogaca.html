    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Canola oil</li>
        <li>Butter, melted</li>
        <li>Plain yogurt</li>
        <li>Beaten eggs</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>Finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Egg yolks</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix the flour with baking soda in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix the canola oil, butter, yogurt, eggs, sour cream, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Gradually stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients to form a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Knead and squeeze the dough in the bowl until it is no longer sticky, about 5 minutes. Stir the feta cheese, parsley, olive oil, and paprika together in a bowl with a fork to make a filling.</li>
        <li>Make each dumpling by pinching off about 2 1/2 tablespoons of dough; roll into a ball about 1 3/4 inches across between your hands, and press it into a flat circle 3 inches across on your palm.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 scant tablespoon of filling into the center of the circle. Bring the edges of the circle together over the filling, and pinch them together to make a fat, round little stuffed dumpling.</li>
        <li>Set the dumplings onto the parchment paper-lined baking sheet, seam sides down.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl, and brush the pogaca tops with the egg yolk. Sprinkle each with about 1/4 teaspoon of sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are shiny, brown, and crackled, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
